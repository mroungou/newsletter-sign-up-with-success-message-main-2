## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned more about using objets and how to access them. I haven't been using them and I felt this was a good start to kinda start looking into how they can be intergrated in such a small project.

### Continued development

This is the second time I work on this project. I'm hoping to use some kind of framework the next time I work on it.
